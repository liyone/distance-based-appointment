Step 3.5: Front-End Deployment to S3 and Cloudfront
Summary: Deploy the compiled front-end code to S3 as a static website served through Cloudfront.

Description: This step involves building the front-end code using Vite, creating an S3 bucket for hosting the static files, configuring the bucket for static website hosting, and setting up a Cloudfront distribution for improved performance and global reach.

Dependencies:

Front-end code built with Vite
AWS Account
S3 Bucket
Cloudfront Distribution
Steps:

Build the front-end code: Run the appropriate Vite command to build the production bundle. This typically involves a command like npm run build.
Create an S3 bucket: In the AWS Console, create a new S3 bucket. Choose a unique and descriptive name for the bucket.
Enable static website hosting: Enable static website hosting for the S3 bucket. Set the index document to index.html and the error document to index.html.
Upload the built files: Upload the contents of the dist folder (generated by Vite) to the S3 bucket.
Set access permissions: Configure the S3 bucket to allow public read access to the uploaded files.
Create a Cloudfront distribution: Create a Cloudfront distribution with the S3 bucket as the origin. Choose the appropriate settings for your desired performance and security.
Update DNS records: Update your DNS records to point the domain name to the Cloudfront distribution.
Acceptance Criteria:

The front-end code is compiled and bundled using Vite.
An S3 bucket is created for static website hosting.
Static website hosting is enabled on the S3 bucket.
Built files are uploaded to the S3 bucket.
Public read access is granted to the uploaded files.
A Cloudfront distribution is created with the S3 bucket as the origin.
DNS records are updated to point the domain name to the Cloudfront distribution.
The front-end website is accessible through the domain name.
Additional Notes:

This step assumes basic familiarity with AWS S3 and Cloudfront services.
Specific configurations for S3 and Cloudfront may vary depending on your specific needs.
Consider implementing additional security measures like HTTPS and access control lists.
Next Steps:

Configure backend API integration with the deployed front-end application.
Implement additional features and functionalities.
Perform testing and quality assurance.
